                <div className='blurb'>
                    <p> My name is Taylor Williamson and I am a recent Computer Science and 
                        Engineering graduate from Texas A&M University actively seeking a 
                        software engineering position in the Houston area.
                    Throughout my collegiate career, I have gained a plethora of experience 
                        developing desktop and console applications in primarily C++ and Java, 
                        while simultaneously exploring and learning about other languages such 
                        as python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript in my free time. Since graduation, 
                        I have been continuing to learn and explore the world of full-stack 
                        development, and learning in-demand skills such as web development
                        utilizing the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, SQL, and JavaScript/TypeScript.
                    I am constantly learning and gathering new knowledge as I am striving to become a more efficient,
                        effective, and well-rounded developer. </p>
